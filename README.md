An "about me" website for Evan Brentson detailing his involvement with computer science and music.

This website will follow a certain "branch-like" flow:

The main page will be an introductory webpage about Evan, showing a headshot, a very short introduction, and 2 buttons that link to other pages
It will also have a link to a contact page
Each button page will be the start of a branching flow.

Link one will lead to an about me website with expicit focus on Evan's software development. Link two will lead to a website about his involvements in music

Each site will have an about me page, and a portfolio page, Additionally. They will each have a link that goes to the aforementioned contact page

The music site alone will link to a "lessons" website, which is a standalone website that provides the user information about Evan (as well as other teachers) lesson schedules, policies, etc.
