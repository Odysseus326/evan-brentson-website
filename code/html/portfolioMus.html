                            <p>The Vintage band is based in Des Moines, WA and performs around Veterans Day. The group performs a mixture of military and classical music composed by renowned composers. John Welsh, the director of the group is a former Conductor for the United States Air Force Band. His instruction boasts a disciplined approach that results in an efficient rehearsal. This has taught Evan much on how to make the most of group rehearsals.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>The performance consisted of repertoire intended to impress and inspire children with classical and pop music in an symohony setting. The event hosted a field trip for students of the Olympia School District, where each student got to bring a recorder. In the symphony orchestra’s performance of “Ode to Joy” (Beethoven), over 400 students would accompany the piece on their recorders. Evan believed this to be a once in a life-time opportunity to witness something like this.</p>

                            <p>The ensemble was originally formed because of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. It began as an online “experiment” where music was recorded and made digitally.

                        <p>Another group Evan participated in was <abbr title="Washington State University's">WSU's</abbr> Basketball Drumline.

                        <br>
                        <p>Evan played marching snare drum. The group provided opportunities for its regular members to fill the role as section leader for their instrument by letting them decide what cadences to perform, allowing them to tap-off, cut-off, and more.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This group provided college credit, and its members were required to audition for their instrument.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Evan was usually required to be present at rehearsals or events nearly every day of the week. <abbr title="Pacific-12 Athletic Conference">PAC-12</abbr> football games necessitated the group's members being capable of learning a new field show every week, including music, field positions, and effects.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Evan landed a spot on the fourth snare position (out of nine) after several days of tryouts. At the time, WSU’s Cougar Marching Band was directed by Dr. Troy Bennefield, Dr. Sarah Miller, and Brent Edwards (Drumline Instructor).</p>

                            <p>He spent his first year as a Crash Cymbal, glockenspiel & bass drum player. Evan landed a position on snare drum during his sophomore year, which he would hold until he graduated.

                            <p> The same year, Emmanuel Olaiya, a former member of The Academy world-class drum corps' snareline was hired to be a full-time instructor for the drumline, where he would teach Evan much about drum-corps level rhudimental drumming, marching technique, and leadership styles.</p>

                            <p>These camps challenged participants to improve playing skills, marching skills, attention to finer detail, and playing perfection as a group. Evan participated in these camps as an aspiring marching snare drummer and received a callback after the first camp and was offered a contract to be a snare drummer during the second camp for the upcoming season. Due to personal circumstances, he had to decline the offer.</p>
