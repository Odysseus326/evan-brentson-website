                            <p>Evan is a (mostly) self-taught software developer with skills and experience working with front-end and back-end technologies, and an extensively trained percussionist. He has an <abbr title="Associate of Science">AS</abbr> in science and an <abbr title="Associate of Arts">AA</abbr> in music. He also has hundreds of unique experiences that developed him into a strong leader with a large set of practical skills and a sense for business.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Evan found his passion for technology and music in middle school and continued to explore them through high school engineering and music classes. After graduation, he attended Washington State University with hopes of getting a degree in Computer Science but would return home after the first year and attend Pierce College. Evan would later graduate with an <abbr title="Associate of Science">AS</abbr> in Science and an <abbr title="Associate of Arts">AA</abbr> in music. He also gained a strong business sense during his 4 years as a department leader for a grocery store.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Evan chose not to continue with education at university. He believed it would be a better use of time and resources to learn on his own, utilizing the many resources available online and learning directly from those who exist within the relevant industries.</p>

                        <p>Most of Evan’s training in both software engineering and music comes directly from hands-on learning. He would temper his knowledge with experience through creating applications or performing repertoire on one of his instruments.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Evan’s mission in software development requires that he is always learning. With a rapidly changing tech industry, he keeps an eye out for new concepts or practices to learn and grow his skillset so he can stay ahead of the curve.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As for music, Evan believes his experiences as a musician are responsible for much of his growth as an individual. Regardless of his love for percussion and performing, music is a powerful opportunity to learn from and collaborate with others, improving skills in teamwork, creativity, and other qualities not easily learned while working at a desk.</p>

                        <p>Evan is a very well-rounded and skilled individual with plenty of experiences and relationships to show for it. As both a developer and a musician, he believes he stands out in each field because of his involvement with the other. Both activities promote very different mindsets and behaviors, and Evan believes he embodies the best of both.</p>
