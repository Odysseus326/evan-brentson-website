                            <p>Evan is a software developer with full-stack experience. He is also and an extensively trained percussionist. Evan has an <abbr title="Associate of Science">AS</abbr> in science and an <abbr title="Associate of Arts">AA</abbr> in music, as well as many experiences that shaped him into</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Evan found his passion for technology and music in middle school and continued exploring them in high school engineering and music classes. After graduation, he attended Washington State University with hopes of getting a degree in Computer Science but would return home after the first year and attend and eventually graduate from Pierce College. He also gained a lot of business experience during his 5 years as a department leader in retail.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Evan chose not to continue with education at university. He believed it would be a better use of time and resources to learn on his own, learning directly from those who exist within the relevant industries.</p>

                        <p>Most of Evan‚Äôs training in both software engineering and music comes directly from hands-on learning. He would temper his knowledge with experience through creating applications or performing repertoire on one of his instruments.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Evan‚Äôs mission in software development requires that he is always learning. Whether the content is old or new, he finds value in every new concept as it stengthens his fundamental understanding of the whole practice.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>As for music, Evan believes his experiences as a musician are to thank for much of his growth as an individual. Regardless of his love for percussion and performing, music is a powerful opportunity to learn from and collaborate with others, improving skills in teamwork, creativity, and other qualities not typically learned while working at a desk.</p>

                        <p>Evan is a very well-rounded and skilled individual with plenty of experiences and relationships to show for it. As both a developer and a musician, he believes he stands out in each field because of his involvement with the other. Both activities promote very different mindsets and behaviors, and Evan believes he embodies the best of both.</p>
