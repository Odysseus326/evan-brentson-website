                        <h3>My Beginnings</h3>
                            <p>In 6<sup>th</sup> grade, I joined my middle school band's percussion section. I played through 8th grade where I would graduate from middle school. I also took a 'Gateway to Technology’ class during this time that would spark my interest in tech.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>When I entered high school, I joined the band's percussion program, where I would remain until graduation. I learned how to play several percussion instruments and eventually became leader of my section. A lot my academic focus was spent dabbling in trades and tech. Construction, mechanics, sciences. It wasn't until a programming course sparked my interest for development</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I graduated high school and left for university with the intention of furthering my music skills and getting a degree in computer science.</p>

                        <h3>My Journey</h3>
                        <p> I attended Washington State University for my freshman year of college, studying in pre-requisite courses for a computer science degree and  playing as a snare drummer for the Cougar Marching Band.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I left <abbr title="Washington State University">WSU</abbr>  after the first year for a more affordable option. I got a job in retail and enrolled at Pierce College  in Puyallup. I continued my studies in computer science, and eventually added music as a major. I became heavily involved in the music department and the wider music community, performing with many groups. Eventually I would graduate with my AS in Science and AA in Music.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I held my job in retail for nearly six years. Starting as a cashier, I eventually became the department lead for the deli department.</p>
